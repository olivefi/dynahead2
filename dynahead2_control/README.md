### Dynahead Control
Depends on apt package `ros-noetic-dynamixel-sdk`.

If you want a more extensive way of doing dynamixel stuff, refer to implementation in [Lenai Gripper](https://bitbucket.org/leggedrobotics/lenai_gripper/src/main/lenai_gripper/src/dynamixel_interface.cpp), as it uses dynamixel workbench and does more stuff with settings.
